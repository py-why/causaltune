# Contributing to causaltune

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Please keep all your communication respectful. 


## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track public issues and feature requests from the community, as well as accept pull requests.


## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests: unit and End-2-End if possible.
3. If you've added a new feature or changed the behavior of existing one, update the tests and the relevant documentation in [README.md](./README.md) and [online documentation code](./docs).
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License Version 2.0.
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License Version 2.0](./LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/py-why/causaltune/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/py-why/pipelinewise/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background and setup
Here's [a great example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Describe your source/target setup.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Tabs for indentation 
* Google docstring format for Python documentation.
* Single quotes for string literals 
* We've started using SonarLint PyCharm plugin to detect code complexity among other issues to improve code quality.
* You can try running `black` for autoformatting. You can do this with `make format`

## Versioning
We use [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
